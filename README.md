# Hangman-problem
This is a simple console based application created using python.
Following are the rules of the game:
  - User has 5 lives for every round of the game
  - Each wrong input will reduce the life by 1
  - User can only enter character, inputting anything else will reduce the life by 1
  - User can input only single character at a time
  - Inputting same correct character will do nothing
  - Inputting same wrong character will tell the user that they already tried this and no life will be reduced
  - If the user guessed the correct word, they win the game.
